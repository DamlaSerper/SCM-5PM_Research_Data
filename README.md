# ResearchData
Research data of the linked journal article, is composed of input and output files of the LIGGGHTS-PFM simulations (Project folders) and an Excel data sheet (Results_Excel) which includes calculated data. 

The contents are the simulation data and results of cake formation in centrifugal filtration using conventional (mesh) method and novel Switchable contact model (SCM, primitive) method. (For more information see the linked article and the source code of SCM:)

## Folder and file structure
There are two main folders with names "Centrifugation" and "Calibration".

"Centrifugation" folder contains the input and output files and the results of comparing computational mesh and SCM methods.

"Calibration" folder contains the input and output files and the results of calibration of the transition fraction value.

"Centrifugation" folder contains three sub-folders named "Normal_LIGGGHTS_PFM_Mesh_smult_30X", "SCM_1PM_LIGGGHTS_PFM_Primitive_transfrac_0_00233_smult_30X" and "SCM_5PM_LIGGGHTS_PFM_Primitive_transfrac_0_00233_smult_30X".

Each of these 3 sub-folders include the below list of files:

### Input files
#### In. file (Script of LIGGGHTS commands)
- in.cent_walltype_walls_sizemultiplierX_transitionfraction (walltype: mesh/primitive; size_multiplier: 30; transitionfraction: calibrated value 0.00233)

#### Mesh files (For representing geometries)
- bottom_disk.stl 
- bot_cyl.stl
- cone.stl
- dem_walls_sizemultiplierX_14micronpore_mod_mesh.stl (sizemultiplier: 30)(Only exists in mesh case)
- in_cyl.stl
- top_cyl.stl
- top_disk.stl
- in_cap.stl

#### Dump file (Initial no_overlap packing of particles)
- dump.atom_info_1

#### LIGGGHTS executable file (Compiled on the supercomputer)
- lmp_puhti

#### Batch file (For batch job submission to supercomputer)
- b.walltype_sizemultiplierX_transitionfraction (walltype: mesh, prim; size_multiplier: 30; transitionfraction: none (mesh case), 0.0023)

### Output files
#### LIGGGHTS forced restart file (Generated by LIGGGHTS due to killing the job earlier than its completion)
- restart_forced_ligghts_simulationtimestep.data (simulationtimestep)
        
#### LIGGGHTS log file (Generated by LIGGGHTS)
- log.liggghts
        
#### Slurm file (Generated by supercomputer for each batch job sent)
- slurm_jobID.out (jobID)

#### Text file reporting number of atoms each step (Generated by LIGGGHTS as defined in the in.file)
- numatoms.txt
        
#### Dump files (Atom positions, velocities and properties, generated by LIGGGHTS as defined in the .in file)
- dump.atom_info_ac_simulationtimestep (simulationtimestep)

### Results 
Results are collected in Excel to be compared. Here you can also find .mp4 video files that are comparing the three methods.

#### Results_Excel
Here you can find information about how long the simulations took and how much particles are left at the final step (timestep correscponding to 0.4 second). You can also see the derived quantities such as time reduction and particle loss %.

##### Case properties
Here you can find information about the case set-up (such as: mesh size, number of steps it will take to reach one second, number of horizontal and vertical pores, number of particles added, number of mesh elements, etc.). You can also see the comparison of different size multipliers in terms of number of elements vs computation time.

### Mesh quality
Here you can find the metrics that are related to mesh quality.
